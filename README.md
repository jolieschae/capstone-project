A prototype of my social media app, Pullup, built and designed by an artist with artists in mind. Pullup is a hub for creatives of all mediums to host events, connect with followers, display their portfolios, share what they've been up to, and connect and collaborate with others across all creative sectors, allowing them to build an image and monetize off their passions. It's where appreciators can explore new events and happenings, find and follow their favorite artists, share what they're interested in with others, and browse their feeds. Artists and event organizers can post events, put out ads for gigs, blog, and discuss their interests on community forums. Whether you're a singer, dancer, musician, photographer, painter, sculpter, fashion designer, comedian, or graphic designer, there is a community to be found on Pullup.

The brand and idea was conceptualized by myself during the early phases of my software engineering bootcamp. An iteration of the initial project that I worked on alongside a group can also be found on my Github. The mission of Pullup meant a great deal to me, and by the end of my program, I felt compelled to see it through. The prototype of this application is currently built on React.js and Flask.
