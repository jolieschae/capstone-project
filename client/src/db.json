Flanked by his two best friends, Michael's first instinct is to go skateboarding in the park, but as the trio reflects on their future, a mysterious man (Iddo Goldberg) approaches and asks them if anyone wants to earn some easy cash... Come see how it all plays out! Can't wait to see you guys there!",
